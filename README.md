# homework05

### Configuration
1. Clone this repository to your computer: open git bash in PycharmProject folder and use command `git clone git@github.com:PythonCoronaCourse/homework05.git`
1. Open freshly cloned folder as a project in Pycharm.
1. Configure Pycharm by clicking `Edit Configurations...` in right upper corner and point to `script.py` in `Script path` field.
1. If there's a problem with `Python interpreter` fix it according to tutorial titled "Virtual Environment" on our Facebook group.
1. Create a new branch named after you with command `git checkout -b your-name` (of course provide your name in place of "your-name").

### Homework completion
1. Open `script.py` file. 
1. In the place of `pass` keywords in `perform_cats_routine` and `bore_a_cat` functions write an implementation, so the functions act according to their docstrings (the text closed in triple quote marks")
1. At the end running the script should result in printing of:
```
ROAR
GRRAU
GRRAU
ROAR
ROAR
ROAR
GRRAU
```
1. Add your changes to your local repository with `git add script.py` and **commit** them.
1. Push your homework with `git push -u origin your-name` (again remember to provide your name).

Remember to make changes **only** inside methods definitions, don't move pieces of code around and so on, write your code only in the place of `pass` statements.
